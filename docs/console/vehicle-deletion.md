# Vehicle deletion

**Status:** Current | **Last Updated:** August 2026

The Vehicles panel can permanently delete a vehicle and everything fitted or
stored on it. The action lives as a **Delete Vehicle** row action (trash icon)
in the global Vehicles panel, alongside the expand chevron into
Components/Permissions. It is not (yet) available on a player's own Vehicles
tab — see [Scope](#scope).

This is the most destructive single action the console offers for a vehicle.
Unlike a permission edit or a refuel (reversible, or at worst re-runnable) a
delete cannot be undone once it lands — the only guardrails are the
confirmation phrase, the danger-styled confirm dialog, and an automatic
full-database safety backup taken before any delete SQL runs. See
[Safety backup](#safety-backup) and
[Frozen while a delete is pending](#irreversibility).

## What counts as "the vehicle"

Unlike a base — whose id and permission actor id differ, resolved through a
`buildings → building_instances → actor_fgl_entities → actors` chain — a
vehicle **is** its own actor: `dune.vehicles.id = dune.actors.id`. There is no
multi-hop actor enumeration the way base deletion needs for buildings and
placeables; deleting a vehicle is deleting exactly one `dune.actors` row, plus
whatever the game's own declared foreign keys cascade from it.

Verified against a real production schema dump (`.claude/dune_backup.sql`)
and confirmed live in a rolled-back transaction before this feature was
written:

| Constraint | Action |
|---|---|
| `dune.vehicles.id` → `dune.actors.id` | `CASCADE` |
| `dune.vehicle_modules.vehicle_id` → `dune.vehicles.id` | `CASCADE` |
| `dune.inventories.vehicle_module_id` → `dune.vehicle_modules.id` | `CASCADE` |
| `dune.backup_vehicles.vehicle_id` → `dune.vehicles.id` | `CASCADE` |
| `dune.recovered_vehicles.vehicle_id` → `dune.vehicles.id` | `CASCADE` |
| `dune.overmap_players.vehicle_id` → `dune.actors.id` | `SET NULL` |

Deleting the vehicle's `dune.actors` row cascades away `vehicles`,
`vehicle_modules`, their `inventories` and `items`, and any
`backup_vehicles`/`recovered_vehicles` record.

One caveat on the `vehicle_module_id` row above: it is a real constraint, but
it is not the path a vehicle's cargo actually takes. That link is **empty in
production** (0 of 535 inventories in a real dump) — the cargo hold hangs off
`dune.inventories.actor_id`, so it is removed by the `actors` cascade on the
line above it, not by this one. See
[vehicle-storage.md](vehicle-storage.md). Nothing about the delete changes;
the closure is the same either way. As with a base, the one thing
that does **not** cascade from `actors` is the vehicle's map marker
(`dune.markers`/`dune.player_markers`, keyed on the claim actor id but only
FK-cascaded from `map_names`) — this repo previously had no confirmation that
vehicles even receive such markers in practice, but the delete still calls
`dune.permission_actor_destroy(bigint)` first regardless, for the same reason
base deletion does: a `DELETE` matching zero rows is a harmless no-op, and
skipping the call on the assumption that vehicles never get one would be the
kind of assumption that is wrong exactly once.

No new stored procedure was added: the same two shipped functions base
deletion uses (`dune.permission_actor_destroy` and `dune.delete_actors(bigint[])`)
are generic over any actor id, not base-specific, and are composed inside one
transaction the same way `deleteBaseCompletely` composes them.

## A vehicle-specific guard: `dune.actor_state`

Funcom's own vehicle cleanup procedure — `dune.delete_actors_and_respawns_on_server`,
invoked by the game's Deep Desert Coriolis-storm mechanism, see
[base-backups.md](base-backups.md) — refuses to delete a vehicle whose
`dune.actor_state` is `Travel`, `VehicleBackup`, or `VehicleRecovery`: states
meaning the vehicle is mid-overmap-transit with a player attached, or stashed
pending recovery. Admin deletion honors the same exclusion, transcribed from
that procedure rather than invented for this feature — a base has no
equivalent state to check, so this has no base-side counterpart. The check is
gated on `dune.actor_state` existing at all, so an older schema without that
table simply skips it rather than breaking.

This is not the same operation as the game's own cleanup: Funcom's procedure
**recovers** a vehicle (via `store_recovered_vehicles_wiped_before_spawn`)
before removing it from the live map. The admin Delete Vehicle action is a
hard delete — there is no recovery step.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DELETE` | `/api/vehicles/:vehicleId` | Delete the vehicle. Body: `{ confirmation: "DELETE VEHICLE" }`. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/vehicles/:vehicleId/queued-delete` | Cancel a pending queued delete. No confirmation phrase — cancelling is reversible. |
| `GET` | `/api/vehicles/pending-deletes` | Pending queue, grouped by `(map, partitionId)`, the same shape `/api/bases/pending-deletes` returns. |

Deletes are audited as `vehicles.delete`; queued flushes as
`vehicles.flush-queued-delete`. Both go through the phrase-gated
`directDbMutation` helper (`"DELETE VEHICLE"`, matching `"DELETE BASE"`'s
precedent) and are rate limited.

`DELETE /api/vehicles/:vehicleId` requires its own IAM action,
`vehicles:delete` (`console/api/src/actions.js`) — deliberately separate from
`vehicles:mutate`, the shared bucket every other vehicle mutation (roster
save, custodian transfer, refuel, repair) falls into. Those are all
reversible; this one isn't, so a custom policy can grant routine vehicle
management without also granting the ability to permanently delete one.
Unlike bases, vehicles have no `"DELETE /api/vehicles/"` prefix rule in
`REGEX_ACTIONS_BY_METHOD` for the route to fall through to, so this needed its
own explicit pattern entry in `REGEX_ACTIONS_BY_METHOD_PATTERN` — without it,
the route would have silently resolved to the read-only `vehicles:read`
fallback (the same class of gap the system-custodian transfer route closed
earlier; see `vehicle-permissions.md`). `DELETE /api/vehicles/:vehicleId/queued-delete`
(cancelling) stays under `vehicles:mutate`, and needed the same explicit
pattern treatment for the same reason.

## Why deletes are queued for a live map

Vehicles' structural tables have no live-notify path any more than a base's
do: `dune.vehicles`/`dune.vehicle_modules` carry no trigger and no
`pg_notify` channel for a structural despawn, unlike `permission_actor_rank`
writes, which the shipped `permission_set_player_rank`/`permission_remove_player_rank`
procedures do notify on (see [vehicle-permissions.md](vehicle-permissions.md#why-there-is-no-queue)).
A running map server periodically flushes its own in-memory copy of a
vehicle back to Postgres, so a raw delete against a live vehicle's rows can be
silently overwritten (resurrected) on the very next autosave — the same race
the base-delete queue exists to close.

For vehicles the argument is if anything stronger than for bases:
`permission_actor_destroy` **does** call `pg_notify`, telling any listening
map server "permissions destroyed" for that actor, while `delete_actors` does
not notify anything. Running the pair against a live map without a
write-safety gate would tell the server one thing happened while silently
pulling the structural row out from under it — worse than simply doing
nothing, since the server is now told about a change to state it does not
know has vanished.

Vehicle deletion reuses the base-delete queue's shape rather than re-solving
the problem, but as its own parallel queue — vehicles had **no** existing
delete-pending/backed-up infrastructure before this feature, unlike bases:
`vehicleWriteTarget` decides whether the vehicle's partition is currently
write-safe (reusing `vehiclePermissionActor` for location, since a vehicle is
already its own actor with no separate resolver needed). If it is, the delete
runs immediately. If not, it is recorded in
`runtime/generated/pending-vehicle-deletes.json` (gitignored, its own cap of
200 entries — vehicles are far more numerous than bases, so this cap is
tracked independently) and applied the next time that partition is confirmed
down — the same 5-second poll and restart-task `onMapDown` hook that flushes
the other queued writes, extended with its own independent vehicle-delete leg.

The restart hook runs the flush as a *fresh* pass and ignores the retry
backoff, for the reasons given in
[base-deletion.md](base-deletion.md#why-deletes-are-queued-for-a-live-map): a
pass already in flight observed the map as live, and a blocked entry is inside
its retry window most of the time. The 5s poll reuses an in-flight result and
keeps backing off.

**Same divergence as the base queue:** at flush time, finding that the
vehicle no longer exists counts as **success**, not a failure to retry.

## Safety backup

Every delete — immediate or flushed from the queue — triggers a full database
backup **before** any delete SQL runs, exactly as base deletion does (see
[base-deletion.md](base-deletion.md#safety-backup)), tagged with the origin
`vehicle-delete`. If the backup fails, the delete is never attempted — for a
queued flush pass, the entire pass aborts and every entry stays queued,
retried (backup included) on the next tick. One backup covers an entire flush
pass, not one per vehicle.

## Transaction atomicity

The delete itself — the `FOR UPDATE` lock on the vehicle's `actors` row, the
`actor_state` guard, `permission_actor_destroy`, and `delete_actors` — runs
inside one Postgres transaction. Any failure rolls back the whole thing; there
is no code path where the permission layer is torn down but the structural
rows survive, or vice versa.

## Frozen while a delete is pending

<a id="irreversibility"></a>
A vehicle with a delete queued rejects every other mutation — permission edits,
the system-custodian transfer, refueling — with `409`. Repairing vehicle
decay (a bulk, per-player action with no single vehicle id) is deliberately
**not** blocked, mirroring the choice to leave blueprint export enabled
during a pending base delete: it is a lower-blast-radius, reversible action,
and there is no single-vehicle route to guard it on.

In the Vehicles panel, a vehicle with a pending delete shows a danger-toned
pill (trash icon + cancel) in place of its Delete button, and the
Permissions tab's Save/Transfer/rank/remove controls disable with a tooltip
explaining why, the same way they already do for an unclaimed vehicle.

## Scope

Delete Vehicle ships on the global Vehicles panel only, matching how Delete
Base shipped (it never reached a player-scoped Bases tab either). Unlike the
system-custodian transfer button — which reaches both the global panel and a
player's own Vehicles tab — `VehicleTable`'s delete props are optional and
default off, so `PlayerVehiclesTab`'s mount point is unaffected until they are
deliberately wired through there too.

## Response shape

```
DELETE /api/vehicles/{vehicleId}
{ supported, backupCreated,
  result: { ok, queued?, vehicleId, map?, partitionId?, actorId?,
            deletedModuleCount? } }
```

`result.queued: true` means the delete was recorded and will apply once the
vehicle's map is confirmed down; otherwise the delete already ran and
`deletedModuleCount` describes how many `vehicle_modules` rows were removed
along with it.
